# Agartha 3.0 XNA

A prototype game engine made in 2013 that was written in C# and XNA. Features a single level, a few enemies and power ups. This was designed to replace a [game demo](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-html5) built in 2010 that was never completed. This is also the successor of the [Flash](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-flash) port that was never completed.

What makes this game engine unique was it used a tile engine based on the Nintendo Entertainment Systems PPU (Picture Processing Unit). It's built similiar to a game engine found on classic video game consoles from the 80s and 90s.

# What's different from the Flash Version?

- A tile engine based on the NES PPU (Picture Processing Unit).
- An action and reaction system used to pass messages between the player and objects.
- A primitive physics engine: The Dolphin that's controlled by the player can now jump out of the water and charge into enemies

# Why was this Abandoned?

Before I answer why I abandoned this project, let's ask why I chose C# and XNA to build this project with. I had to quickly scramble to a new platform to replace the [Flash version](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-flash) of this project that I had designed a few months prior. Unfortunartly (once again) I didn't do my research as Microsoft was discontinuing support for XNA, which forced me to abandon building a game engine altogether. 

# Known Issues

All the scripts and assests are here, the only thing missing are the project files which link the two together. All the assests will need to be reaadded to a new project file and properly assigned to the labels used by the scripts.
