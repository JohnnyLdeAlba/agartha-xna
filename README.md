# Agartha 3.0 XNA

A prototype game engine made in 2013 that was written in C# and XNA. Features a single level, a few enemies and some NPCs. This was designed to replace a [game demo](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-html5) built in 2010 that was never completed. This is the direct successor of the unfinished [Flash](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-flash) port.

What makes this game engine unique is how it draws tiles. The tile engine was loosely based on how tiles are drawn on the Nintendo Entertainment System. This makes it like game engine's found on classic video game consoles from the 80s and 90s.

# What's different from the Flash Version?

- A tile engine based on the NES PPU (Picture Processing Unit).
- An action and reaction system used to pass messages between the player and objects.
- A primitive physics engine: The Dolphin that is controlled by the player can jump out of the water and charge into enemies.

# Why was this Abandoned?

This project was built at a time when Microsoft was getting ready to launch a new console. This also meant XNA - which this project was built upon, was going to become obsolete. Even though XNA would be supported for years to come, the problem with building an engine on a dying API was not knowing when this engine would be completed. 

# Known Issues

All the scripts and assests are here, the only thing missing are the project files which link the two together. All the assests will need to be readded to a new project file and properly assigned to the labels used by the scripts.
