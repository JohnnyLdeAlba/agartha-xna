# Agartha 3.0 XNA

A prototype game engine made in 2013 that was written in C# and XNA. Features a single level, a few enemies and power ups. This was designed to replace a [game demo](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-html5) built in 2010 that was never completed. This is also the successor of the [Flash](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-flash) port that was never completed.
