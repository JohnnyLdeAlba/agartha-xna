# Agartha 3.0 XNA

A prototype game engine made in 2013 that was written in C# and XNA. Features a single level, a few enemies and power ups. This was designed to replace a [game demo](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-html5) built in 2010 that was never completed. This is also the successor of the [Flash](https://github.com/JohnnyLdeAlba/agartha-flash) port that was never completed.

# Known Issues

All the scripts and assests are here, the only thing missing are the project files which link the two together. All the assests will need to be reaadded and properly assigned to the labels used by the scripts.
